# Nashville Software School Tribute Agency

## Description

Our task was to compile a tribute report on an artist we are considering inducting in our fictional Nashville Software School Tribute Agency (NSSTA). We were to create the following pages: Executive Summary, Personal, Career, and News Feed. We used semantic HTML and CSS to create this page, as well as using BEM class declarations, flexbox, embedding for audio files and Google Maps. 

## Installation

To run our code, run a git pull to your internet web directory and pull up index.html on your browser. 


4. Valid HTML. Run each page of HTML code through the html validator at [https://validator.w3.org/](https://validator.w3.org/).


## Usage
1. Click on each individual page on Navigation bar
2. Click on embedded Spotify audio on Home page to listen to Prince and some of his collaborators
3. Click on the embedded Google Maps on Home page to see where his Paisley Home is located and how to find directions to it from anywhere
4. Click on images in News Feed to open links to current events and news
5. Click on social media links in footer to access Prince's pages.

## Project Status
This project is considered complete.
